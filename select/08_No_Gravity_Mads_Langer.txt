Let's pretend
Pretended we are millionaires
We can buy, buy anything we want, oh yeah
And for you, diamonds rings and jelly beans
And for me, a racing car in gasoline, oh yeah.

We have left our hold on for the
City now we dance under the stars

'Cause still either there's no gravity
We are where we want to be, yeah
We just wanna stay here
We just wanna be where
There's no gravity.

Let's pretend
Pretended we are criminals.
In the dark, you'll be Bonnie I'll be Clyde, oh yeah
Justify that we don't need no alibis, no no
You and I, will be strangers in the night, oh yeah.

We have left our hold on for the
City now we dance under the stars.

'Cause still either there's no gravity
We are where we want to be, yeah
We just wanna stay here
We just wanna be where
There's no gravity.

'Cause still either there's no gravity
We are where we want to be, yeah
We just wanna stay here
We just wanna be where
There's no gravity.
