I'm like a forgotten sauce
in the back of shelf
Just expired
and was thrown away
気にしないでいられない
馬鹿じゃないと耐えれない
見れば見るほど 手に余る美貌
思い出せば誘われてたろう
今はない希望 追いかけても
もう不毛 I know
No gravity shoes,
no gravity heart
This isn't me!
It's happens every time
I'm with you
Something about you,
something I said
They pop like soap bubbles
from my head
脳内総動員で考えたって
大抵グラスの底に沈むの
No gravity shoes,
no gravity heart
This isn't me!
It's happens every time
I'm with you
Yeah I can't forgive myself
and figured it out
I'm a coward,
time is flying by fast
期待しないわ 人の愛
興味ないかもわからない
友達や家族、兄にまで所属
やるせないな 避けているんだろう
言葉の包囲網 ああこれ以上
もう不毛 I know
No gravity shoes,
no gravity heart
This isn't me!
It's happens every time
I'm with you
Something about you,
something I said
They pop like soap bubbles
from my head
脳内総動員で考えたって
大抵グラスの底に沈むの
No gravity shoes,
no gravity heart
This isn't me!
It's happens every time
I'm with you
It's all floating
Feel like an astronaut
It doesn't suit me,
but I'm trying to be cool
抗わない 繕わない
心の奥で繋がりたいや
